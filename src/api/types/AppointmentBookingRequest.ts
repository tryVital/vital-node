     * If `true`, when the PSC system fails to confirm the booking within `sync_confirmation_timeout_millisecond`, this API
     * endpoint would respond with a `pending` appointment. The booking attempt will continue asynchronously in background, until either:
     *
     * 1. the appointment moves to the reserved or confirmed state because an acknowledgement from the PSC system has been received; OR
     * 2. the pending appointment moves to the cancelled state because the `async_confirmation_timeout_millisecond` timeout is reached.
     *
     * You will receive `labtest.appointment.updated` webhooks for all the relevant status changes (pending, confirmed, reserved
     * and cancelled).
     *
     * If `false` (default), when the PSC system fails to confirm the booking, this API endpoint would respond with
     * 500 Internal Server Error.
