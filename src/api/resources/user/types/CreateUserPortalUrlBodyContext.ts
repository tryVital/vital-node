/**
 * `launch`: Generates a short-lived (minutes) portal URL that is intended for launching a user from your
 * authenticated web context directly into the Junction User Portal. This URL is not suitable for asynchronous
 * communications due to its verbosity as well as short-lived nature.
 *
 * `communications`: Generates a long-lived (weeks) but shortened portal URL that is suitable for Emails, SMS
 * messages and other communication channels. Users may be asked to verify their identity with Email and SMS
 * authentication, e.g., when they open a short link on a new device. ℹ️ This enum is non-exhaustive.
